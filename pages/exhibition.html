                Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
                on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can
                learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not
                travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
                exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so
                make sure you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the
                Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between
                10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with
                our team of experts. During the school holidays we run special
                holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
                on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
                explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
                join, send us a message.

                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
                Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
                about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
                the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
                journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
                Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our
                solar system.

              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
              Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
              and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
              understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
              history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
              including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
              transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
              only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
              Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
