                Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
                on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can
                learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not
                travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
                exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so
                make sure you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the
                Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between
                10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with
                our team of experts. During the school holidays we run special
                holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
                on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
                explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
                join, send us a message.

                As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
                create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
                give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
                learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
                will excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here
                to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to
                bring your students through for a visit.
